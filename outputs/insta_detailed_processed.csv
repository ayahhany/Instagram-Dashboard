.
However, damage can still occur without showing any visible signs that can be seen on the skin. It can occur on a cellular level. It’s also cumulative because our skin can’t always repair the damage before being exposed to the sun again.
.

☀️UVB rays—> are responsible for skin burns, which increase the risk of skin cancer. They can only penetrate the epidermis (top layer of the skin) very few rays can make it to the dermis (2nd layer), and cause DNA damage. DNA damage triggers melanocytes (pigment cells), to produce melanin to protect the skin. This shows that tanning is a sign of skin damage.Usually strongest in the summer, and they tend to vary depending on the time of the day, location and time of the year
.
.
☀️UVA—> can penetrate the ozone layer by 95%, can also penetrate clouds and windows. They can penetrate deep to the dermis (2nd layer of the skin). They don’t really vary during the year, they’re present all year round. They play a role in skin cancer and a greater role in skin premature aging (photoaging).
.
⭐️The sunlight is predominantly UVA.
.
🤓Nerdy facts:
☄️UVA is efficient at generating reactive oxygen species that can damage DNA via indirect photosensitizing reactions.
☄️UVB is directly absorbed by DNA which causes molecular rearrangements forming the specific photoproducts such as cyclobutane dimers and 6 – 4 photoproducts. Mutations and cancer can result from many of these modifications to DNA.

⭐️ Always wear sunscreen.
⭐️ understand that acretin here in egypt is OTC, (over the counter), which means, it doesn’t need a doctor’s prescription. However, in several countries abroad, it’s considered a prescription medication. Different countries regulate things differently and that’s normal. However, acretin (tertinoin) is a potent retinoid, do not advise people to use it without professional medical supervision.

As some of you may know, I’m a Medical student, and I try to run this online blog where I talk about skincare/skin from a scientific stand-point. But as I always say, the person behind this account is so much more than skincare. And I have my ups and downs. If you’ve been following me for a while, you probably noticed my pattern of inconsistency with posting last year. This was because that I totally neglected my mental health, and thought that pushing my limits would lead to a positive outcome, and as expected, it only lead to me not being able to function, and losing track of what if feels like to be normal. It took me a long while to want to heal, and now, I’m still healing and trying to be gentle with myself.
.
Here's a reminder that it's ok to feel like you're nowhere near where you want to be.
Everything in life is a process, and rushing it is simply impossible, and this is what I’m trying to do. Heal :)
Go easy on yourself. I love you🤍

⭐️ I noticed improved skin texture
⭐️ more glow to my skin

withhags,https://www.instagram.com/p/CYyq3NwpmFm/,1378,clip,"You need around 2mg of sunscreen per cm2 of your skin to get the protection labelled on the bottle. So if your bottle says SPF 50, you need 2mg/cm2 to get the SPF 50.
.
Our faces aren’t the same size obviously speaking, but based on the average face size you need around 1/4 a teaspoon for your face (1/2 for your face and neck). Some people may need less than 1/4 a teaspoon, and other people may need more. However, we usually tend to underapply, so sticking to a 1/4 teaspoon would be much safer.
.
⭐️If you love to follow the fingers method for sunscreen application. 1/4 a tea spoon of a fluid sunscreen would probably be more than 3 fingers as it’s more spreadable.
.
I personally apply 2 layers of sunscreen to minimize skip areas (patchy application) and ensure that I am having an even layer of sunscreen to get the maximum protection possible. Specially that I usually opt for fluid sunscreens that spread easier and more and can give the illusion of putting a larger amount.
.
If you use the 2-3 fingers method and find it enough, keep using it🤍.

.
⭐️لو بتحبوا تحطوا الsunscreen بطريقة الصوابع. ١/٤ معلقة بنسبة كبيرة هيكون أكثر من ٣ صوابع عشان القوام بتاع السائل بيتفرد أكثر من الكريم.
.
أنا بفضل أحط الsunscreen علي طبقتين، عشان أقبل من فرصة إني أكون فوتت حتت من وشي و أتأكد إني بحط طبقة متساوية علي وشي كدة عشان أخذ أكثر حماية ممكنة. خصوصاً إني في الأغلب بستعمل الsunscreen السائل و هو بيتفرد أكثر و أسهل و ممكن يدي إحساس خاطىء إننا بنستعمل كمية كبيرة.

two things i forgot to mention(the usual):

1. treating white stretch marks is almost impossible. you can only prevent them from getting worse! but nothing’s easier than treating red stretch marks! (try using @ledabeauty stretch marks lotion or @bio_oileg)

2. its safe to bleach your butt hair! it’s actually a bonus and makes waxing/sugaring easier and lighter on the long run 💁🏽‍♀️

Ramadan is about connecting with God, but this year it’s completely different.
Mosques are empty and so are streets, and in this new experience, we are the ones who choose to see beauty.
There is ABSOLUTE BEAUTY in this EMPTINESS.
This Ramadan, connect with God from Home❤️. It was a pleasure working with @nadineyasserr1 she is the sweetest, kindest, and most professional person ever❤️ .

Eternally grateful for so many things. ☀️",2022-03-07,17:30:06,1.5209876543209877,1.4479012345679014

Details :

1️⃣ squats: 4 sets of 8,8,6,6 (so first 2 sets were 8 reps then last 2 sets were only 6)

2️⃣ Kas glute bridge: 5x15 (basically hip thrusts but with less range of motion)

3️⃣ bulgarians drop set : 3 x 10,10,10 so each set is 30 reps each 10 is a different weight (start with the heaviest and then lower the weight after the first 10 and second 10) then switch legs (you might need a break first 🥵)

4️⃣ finally RDLs 3x8

🌟Feeling back pain whenever you lift something off the ground?
.
🌟Well that's because you slouch when you bend and that puts pressure on your lower back.
.
🌟Avoid that by either deadlifting or squatting whenever you want to pick up something!

-1/2 tsp white or black pepper
-1 tbsp olive oil
-4-5 eggs

super fun and bubbly couple of days. i’ve been really focusing on finding balance in movement and exercising in ways that feels good to me instead of feeling like i HAVE to. starting off my days with the usual lemon ginger water and a gentle yoga class, followed by lemon blueberry baked oats for breakfast (this turned out INSANELY GOOD, recipe will be up soon). then headed to @thegrocereg supermarket opening event, where i picked up a few things for the house🍓🥬🥕🥦🫐 and met up with the fam for lunch. saturday started pretty much the same, except i woke up extra early (joining the 7 am club 🙋🏽‍♀️) to squeeze in a morning walk before heading over to @ananda.community to teach my flexibility class. we did a mini photoshoot after, so keep your eye out for some cool photos soon. packed my breakfast oats in a jar and then spent the rest of the morning planning+organizing my life for next month📝

tell me your current favorites in the comments👇🏽

1. @tabali.bistro wholewheat and oat bread🥙 i buy a couple of packs and keep them in my freezer to eat throughout the week. perfect for sandwiches, mana’eesh, dipping, and you can cut it up then bake to turn into crunchy chips

2. olive spread 🫒 my favorite is @wadi.food with spicy chili 🌶 but you can usually find so many different variations to use in sandwiches, on rice cakes, or even mixed in salad dressings

3. oat pasta 🍝 almost the same as regular pasta but with added fiber from the oats. be aware that most available brands are NOT gluten-free, and the most common ones are @dobella.eg and @lino.oats

4. frozen fruit+veg 🧊 did you know that frozen produce has the same benefits as fresh? i’ll make a video about it soon, but they’re SO convenient to just pull out of the freezer and add to any dish. don’t underestimate the power of frozen food

5. oat flour 🍰 much more nutrient-dense than regular all-purpose flour. i usually mix it with wholewheat flour if i’m baking cakes, cookies, muffins, etc. and it’s perfect for making mug cake-style baked oats

1. Wash and soak your potatoes (several times)
This removes some of the starch and makes them crispy but make sure to dry them really well

2. Preheat your airfryer
This makes a world of a difference, just like your oven to get a perfect crunch and even cooking you need to preheat (I preheat for 2 min)

3. Oil them
You need to add a spray or a spoon full of oil to get that golden edges

• Place it in the air fryer on 200 for 15 min

4. Shake it !
Midway give it a good shake to make sure they get exposed to the same amount of heat

5. Season!!
You need to get the right seasoning to have that same fries you get when you go out. @knorregypt new fries. mix is perfect

When I love something I get obsessed and my air fryer has been an obsession for over a year now, you can literally make anything in it and it makes life so much easier! Save this post for when you need it and comment for part 2!

Tip1: The brands that I tried, like and trust
Black and decker
Philips
Kenwood
Tornado

2. Preheat your Air Fryer
Preheating makes a world of a difference and makes the food cook evenly and have a Bett crunch

3. My recommended cooing time (this varies from each air fryer but take it as a reference point)
On 200C
Sambusak: 6-7min
Wedges: 18-20 min
Fries: 12-15 min
Wings: 20-25 min
Strips: 12 min

On 190C
Salmon: 15 min
Pane: 16-18min

You minimized food waste and you got yourself an amazing broth.

second one is also me being bored and taking a random picture of the road.
third, just simply my room back there in Saudi Arabia, which is not my room anymore. (thinking about this makes me really sad, cause i get attached to things, places and people pretty easily, and i miss my room so much)
forth, as you can see is a two hour call with noha, which was sort of therapeutic in a way, we used to talk A LOT back then, we didn't talk about anything specific, we just enjoyed each other's company. i really miss this and i miss you. @nohaa_mahmoud

There are often times where we aren’t able to dance up to our best potential - or have the energy whether physically or mentally to do things we set out to. This made me not want to post a choreo I really enjoyed with my friends, so much in fact.. and I’m still a work in progress into becoming the best version of myself, that said, I don’t want to not post something I’m not 100% happy about just because I expected more of myself. I want to accept it, love it, and know when’s the right time to expect more of myself. 🤍",2022-04-10,19:05:46,1.0222627737226277,1.1530656934306565
